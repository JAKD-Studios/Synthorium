# Synthorium Dev Notes

## This is the documentation of my progress and thought processs while creating my horror game

## The rules I'm giving myself while making the game:
  -   Create a well polished and fun horror game
  -   Build map generation, character generation, and gameplay dynamics using AI prompt engineering or other techniques
  -   Make sure it has VR support, with smooth gameplay
  -   Most importantly, make it as SCARY as possible

## Goals for gameplay:
  -   Make the game replayable, fun with friends, and rewarding
  -   Every play should be unique, never keep something the exact same
  -   It should take inspiration from FNAF games/The backrooms.
  -   Easy multiplayer to play w/ friends or randoms.
  -   Gameplay should feel like you're being hunted
  -   Once in the actual game, players will never actually see eachother linearly, only through cameras or hearing. 
    
## Gameplay loop:
  -   Lobby place will be prebuilt, the user can either random queue into a party or host their own party and load into a game.
  -   Send the party to a new instance of the actual game server.
  -   Once everyone loads, each user will be sitting in a dark room at a table with a light only above them. A projected screen on the wall infront of them will ask them a set of personal questions about things like their fears, past experiences, etc. These questions will be generated automatically by an LLM. Once answered, the LLM will generate some text or elements the player will find later in gameplay. This will enhance the creepiness and uniqueness of the game.
  -   When a player finishes their survey, the lights will shut off, then they'll be met by an ai voice with a goodbye message, also generated by the LLM (THE VOICE GENERATION SHOULD BE RUN WHILE THE USER IS STILL TAKING THEIR SURVEY). Then, the player will be released from their chair, and prompted to walk into an elevator at the back of the room. The elevator will bring them to the start of the game.
  -   While the players were completing their surveys, the server code has been generating the game's map. Using a combination of Procedural Generation, LLM Prompt Engineering, and randomization, a fun and dynamic map will be created for the users, making sure to always be unique. The algorithm will generate multiple maps, then use an LLM to pick the best option.
  -   Each player will be loaded into their starting area once they get off their elevator, in their own quadrant of the map. This area would be assigned during map generation, so it could look like anything. An office, a bedroom, a bathroom, who knows. The player will never be able to actually see other players, because they are in a seperated part of the map from everyone else. The goal of the player will be to use tools to find the other players, and avoid the monsters lurking in the dark. Each game will have a unique map, so every corner will be unpredictable. The game will utilize audio queues, creepy notes on the walls, and darkness, to create a sense of dread in the player. Also, not being able to see, but only hear your friends will add to the creepiness.

# Day 1 (Nov 17 2024)

First, I wanted to find a fast and reliable LLM to use for prompt engineering later, because I knew it'd come up eventually. After some research, I came across groq, which worked perfectly from roblox studio, because I just had to send a HTTP Get request. It responded almost instantly, and I knew it'd work well for the job. 

After insuring it worked well, I wrote a small script that gave the AI a prompt, basically saying: You're building a map for my game, it needs to be this big with this many rooms, each room should be in this size range, blah blah blah. After it spat out data for a map, I parsed it and had the script automatically create the map. What came out wasn't exactly breathtaking. I changed up the prompt a few times, but the map it gave was always inconsistent and honestly just ugly. 

First big decision: This game will not fully rely on an LLM to generate its map. I'll do more research tomorrow.

# Day 2 (Nov 18 2024)

Today I'll research and try to find the best technique to generate maps for my game.
