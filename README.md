# Synthorium

## This is my dev notes/documentation of my progress and workflow on my roblox horror game. 
## The goals I've set for myself are as follows:
  -- Create a well polished and fun horror game
  -- Build map generation, character generation, and gameplay dynamics using AI prompt engineering or other techniques
  -- Make the game replayable, fun with friends, and rewarding
  -- Make sure it has VR support
  -- Most importantly, make it SCARY


# Day 1 (Nov 17 2024)
First, I wanted to find a fast and reliable LLM to use for prompt engineering later, because I knew it'd come up eventually. After some research, I came across groq, which worked perfectly from roblox studio, because I just had to send a HTTP Get request. It responded almost instantly.
