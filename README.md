## This is the documentation of my progress and thought process while creating my horror game


## The rules I'm giving myself while making the game:
  -   Create a well polished and fun horror game
  -   Build map generation, character generation, and gameplay dynamics using AI prompt engineering or other techniques
  -   Make sure it has VR support, with smooth gameplay
  -   Most importantly, make it as SCARY as possible


## Goals for gameplay:
  -   Make the game replayable, fun with friends, and rewarding
  -   Every play should be unique, never keep something the exact same
  -   It should take inspiration from FNAF games/The backrooms.
  -   Easy multiplayer to play w/ friends or randoms.
  -   Gameplay should feel like you're being hunted
  -   Once in the actual game, players will never actually see each other linearly, only through cameras or hearing.
  -   Introduce unique collectibles and achievements to encourage exploration.
  -   Randomize objectives for each session to keep gameplay fresh and engaging.


## Gameplay loop:
  -   Lobby place will be prebuilt, the user can either random queue into a party or host their own party and load into a game.
  -   Send the party to a new instance of the actual game server.
  -   Once everyone loads, each user will be sitting in a dark room at a table with a light only above them. A projected screen on the wall in front of them will ask them a set of personal questions about things like their fears, past experiences, etc. These questions will be generated automatically by an LLM. Once answered, the LLM will generate some text or elements the player will find later in gameplay. This will enhance the creepiness and uniqueness of the game.
  -   When a player finishes their survey, the lights will shut off, then they'll be met by an AI voice with a goodbye message, also generated by the LLM (THE VOICE GENERATION SHOULD BE RUN WHILE THE USER IS STILL TAKING THEIR SURVEY).
  -   An AI generated cutscene will play, showing the backstory of the player. It will include at least one tragic event which will be built upon later in the game. The user will come to know the character and how his life is structured.
  -   Then, the player will be released from their chair, and prompted to walk into an elevator at the back of the room. The elevator will bring them to the start of the game.
  -   While the players were completing their surveys, the server code has been generating the game's map. Using a combination of Procedural Generation, LLM Prompt Engineering, and randomization, a fun and dynamic map will be created for the users, making sure to always be unique. The algorithm will generate multiple maps, then use an LLM to pick the best option. Also, the map generation will automatically create triggers for scares and weird events to happen when a user enters a certain area.
  -   Each player will be loaded into their starting area once they get off their elevator, in their own quadrant of the map. This area would be assigned during map generation, so it could look like anything. An office, a bedroom, a bathroom, who knows. The player will never be able to actually see other players, because they are in a separated part of the map from everyone else. The goal of the player will be to use tools to find the other players, and avoid the monsters lurking in the dark. Each game will have a unique map, so every corner will be unpredictable. The game will utilize audio cues, creepy notes on the walls, and darkness, to create a sense of dread in the player. Also, not being able to see, but only hear your friends will add to the creepiness.
  -   Each player will navigate the weird and creepy place, experiencing haunting noises, seeing notes, and other scare factors. The game will have no jumpscares except for subtle movements like something falling or someone running across the end of a hallway. As the player gets further into their building, they'll notice more creepy notes and things related to the tragedy they saw in the cutscene earlier.
  -   Introduce dynamic events that can alter gameplay, such as sudden environmental changes or timed challenges that require players to work together.


## Enhancements Inspired by "The Backrooms" and "Five Nights at Freddy's":
  - **Ambiance and Sound Design**: 
    - Use eerie soundscapes with distant machinery, soft whispers, or unsettling static to create an immersive experience. Layer these sounds to maintain a constant sense of unease.
    - Incorporate unique sounds that signal the presence of monsters, making players hyper-aware of their surroundings.
  
  - **Visual Aesthetics**: 
    - Use a dull color palette with muted colors and lighting to create a sense of abandonment and decay. Yellowed or flickering lights can evoke the feeling of being trapped in a lim inal space.
    - Design rooms that feel familiar but with strange or unsettling alterations, such as warped dimensions or impossible layouts.

  - **Gameplay Mechanics**: 
    - Introduce limited resources, such as a finite amount of light or battery for flashlights, to heighten tension as players navigate the dark.
    - Incorporate a camera system that allows players to monitor areas, but make it unreliable or glitchy, leading to moments of vulnerability.
    - Include objectives that require players to escape or hide from monsters, enhancing the feeling of being hunted.

  - **Narrative Elements**: 
    - Use notes, audio logs, or environmental storytelling to reveal the backstory in a non-linear way, creating intrigue and keeping players engaged.
    - Tailor elements of the game based on players' survey responses, including specific fears or experiences that manifest in the environment or gameplay.

  - **Dynamic Threats**: 
    - Create monsters with distinct patterns or behaviors, making them unpredictable and reactive to players’ movements or sounds.
    - Introduce traps or environmental threats that players must navigate, such as collapsing floors, sudden darkness, or disorienting maze-like areas.

  - **Replayability Elements**: 
    - Have random encounters with monsters or events that change each playthrough, ensuring no two experiences are the same.
    - Incorporate different endings based on players’ choices or actions throughout the game, encouraging exploration and experimentation.

  - **Isolation and Disorientation**: 
    - Design areas that feel empty and disorienting, with long corridors and dead ends, creating a sense of isolation.
    - Implement non-Euclidean designs where spaces don’t logically connect, enhancing the feeling of being trapped in an unending nightmare. ```markdown
## Additional Features and Considerations:
  - **Player Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a system for players to provide feedback on their experiences, which can be used to refine gameplay and enhance future updates.
  - **Community Engagement**: Create a platform for players to share their experiences, theories, and fan art, fostering a community around the game.
  - **Regular Updates**: Plan for periodic updates that introduce new content, such as additional maps, monsters, or gameplay mechanics, to keep the player base engaged.
  - **Accessibility Options**: Ensure the game is accessible to a wider audience by including options for colorblind players, adjustable difficulty levels, and customizable controls.
  - **Marketing Strategy**: Develop a marketing plan that includes teasers, trailers, and community events to build anticipation and excitement leading up to the game's release.
  - **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Prioritize thorough testing phases to identify and fix bugs, ensuring a smooth launch and positive player experience.
  - **Monetization Strategy**: Consider potential monetization options, such as cosmetic DLCs or expansions, while ensuring that the core gameplay remains enjoyable without paywalls.

# Day 1 (Nov 17 2024)

First, I wanted to find a fast and reliable LLM to use for prompt engineering later, because I knew it'd come up eventually. After some research, I came across groq, which worked perfectly from Roblox Studio, because I just had to send a HTTP Get request. It responded almost instantly, and I knew it'd work well for the job. 

After ensuring it worked well, I wrote a small script that gave the AI a prompt, basically saying: You're building a map for my game, it needs to be this big with this many rooms, each room should be in this size range, blah blah blah. After it spat out data for a map, I parsed it and had the script automatically create the map. What came out wasn't exactly breathtaking. I changed up the prompt a few times, but the map it gave was always inconsistent and honestly just ugly. 

First big decision: This game will not fully rely on an LLM to generate its map. I'll do more research tomorrow.

# Day 2 (Nov 18 2024)

After looking at Roblox devforums I found this GitHub repo: https://github.com/Nyapaw/Roblox/tree/master/Dungeon

It includes code to generate a dungeon/maze in 2D, and it looks promising with a good amount of configuration. Later I'll see if I can port it into a 3D version.
